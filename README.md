## ALERT!! I have not tested this yet and have not programmed it. Use at your own risk. I will test when it is delivered.
An Alarm that lets you know if your fridge is open.

## How do i make it?
Project files are pre-built and can be manufactured immediately. Upload GERBER.zip to a PCB manufacturer like PCBway or JLCPCB, and either 3D print the body files or send them over to JLC3DP.
BOM included. If you can't find a match for the less important components, use something similar.
You can either choose manufacturer assembly or assemble it yourself.
Order the parts, and when they arrive, use them in their correct placement.
I would watch a soldering tutorial if you're new.
### How do I put it together?
1.  Use the debugging pins on the PCB to upload the code using Arduino IDE. The pins are ordered like this, closest from the reed switch:
    a. Data 1
    
    b. Data 2
    
    c. GND
    
    d. VCC (3v)
3.  Slide the PCB into Device.step.
4.  Add a CR2032 battery and wait for it to beep.
5.  Add the lid and use the printed screws to mount it.
6.  Attach it to your fridge with some 3M adhesive or double sided tape.
7.  Slide a 4x2mm magnet into the hole on the magnet bar and secure it with hot glue.
8.  Attach that to fridge as well.
9.  Done!

## Your fridge is now timed. Congrats!
